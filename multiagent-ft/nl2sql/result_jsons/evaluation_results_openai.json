Therefore, it involves the `documents`, `templates`, and `reference template types` tables.\n\n2. **Filter the Template Type**:\n   - Start by filtering the `reference template types` table to find the `template type code` associated with the template type description \"PPT\". This can be done using a WHERE clause on `template type description`.\n\n3. **Join Templates Table**:\n   - Join the `templates` table with the `reference template types` table on `template type code` to get all templates that have the PPT type. This will filter out templates that are not of type PPT.\n\n4. **Join Documents Table**:\n   - Join the filtered `templates` table (from step 3) with the `documents` table on `template id`. This will filter out documents that do not use PPT templates.\n\n5. **Count Documents**:\n   - Perform a count on the resulting set of `documents` obtained after the joins to get the total number of documents using PPT templates.\n\n6. **Projection**:\n   - The final output should only include the count of documents, so project the count in the select statement.\n\n**Execution Plan Steps**:\n- Step 1: Scan `reference template types` to filter for `template type description = 'PPT'`.\n- Step 2: Use the result from step 1 to filter records in `templates` on `template type code`.\n- Step 3: Join the filtered `templates` with `documents` on `template id`.\n- Step 4: Aggregate the results from the join operation to count the total number of documents.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the documents that use PPT templates by first filtering on the template type and then joining relevant tables to reach the final count.",

      "query_plan": "1. **Identify Paragraph Counts**: \n   - Start by querying the `paragraphs` table to count the number of paragraphs associated with each `document id`. This can be accomplished using a `GROUP BY` clause on the `document id` and a `COUNT` aggregate function to count the number of `paragraph id`s for each document. This subquery will produce a temporary result set with `document id` and `paragraph_count`.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT document_id, COUNT(paragraph_id) as paragraph_count\n   FROM paragraphs\n   GROUP BY document_id\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter Documents by Paragraph Count**:\n   - Use the results from the previous step to filter out documents that have between 1 and 2 paragraphs. Applying a `WHERE` clause on the `paragraph_count` will yield the desired document IDs.\n   \n   ```sql\n   SELECT document_id\n   FROM (\n       SELECT document_id, COUNT(paragraph_id) as paragraph_count\n       FROM paragraphs\n       GROUP BY document_id\n   ) AS paragraph_counts\n   WHERE paragraph_count BETWEEN 1 AND 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Join with Documents (if additional information or filtering is needed)**:\n   - If further details or filtering on documents are required (e.g., certain document name or description), join the filtered document IDs back to the `documents` table.\n   \n   ```sql\n   SELECT d.document_id, d.document_name, d.document_description\n   FROM documents d\n   INNER JOIN (\n       SELECT document_id\n       FROM (\n           SELECT document_id, COUNT(paragraph_id) as paragraph_count\n           FROM paragraphs\n           GROUP BY document_id\n       ) AS paragraph_counts\n       WHERE paragraph_count BETWEEN 1 AND 2\n   ) AS filtered_documents\n   ON d.document_id = filtered_documents.document_id\n   ```\n\n4. **Optimization Considerations**:\n   - Ensure appropriate indexing on the `document id` column in both `paragraphs` and `documents` tables to improve join and filter performance.\n   - If the filtering and joins are intensive on large datasets, consider caching the results of the paragraph counts as a materialized view or temporary table for repeated queries.\n\nThe above steps will efficiently extract the document IDs with 1 to 2 paragraphs.",

This involves checking the `tourney date` column in the `matches` table, which should be formatted to determine the year part. Use a condition to filter records where the year is either 2013 or 2016.\n\n3. **Extract Year from Tourney Date**: Assuming the `tourney date` is a date or timestamp, use a date function to extract the year from this column. Typically, this can be done using a function such as `YEAR(tourney_date)` or an equivalent function in the specific SQL dialect being used.\n\n4. **Count Matches**: Once records are filtered by the specified years, use the `COUNT` aggregate function to determine the total number of matches that fit the criteria.\n\n5. **Execution Order**:\n   - Select from `matches` table.\n   - Apply a filter to extract records where the `tourney date` is in 2013 or 2016.\n   - Use a date extraction function to isolate the year from the `tourney date`.\n   - Aggregate the results using `COUNT` to derive the total number of matches meeting the criteria.\n\n6. **Optimization Considerations**:\n   - Ensure that there is an index on the `tourney date` column to expedite the filtering process.\n   - If the database has partitioned data by year, leverage partition pruning to quickly access the relevant data subset.\n\nBy following the above steps, we efficiently determine the total number of matches played in the specified years.",

This ensures we only consider matches from the relevant tournament.\n\n3. **Identify Left-Handed Winners**:\n   - Within the filtered results, identify winners who are left-handed.

Thus, the tables involved are `matches` for match details and potentially `players` for detailed player information, specifically the hand attribute.\n\n2. **Filter Matches by Tournament**: \n   - Begin by filtering the `matches` table to only include records where the `tourney_name` is 'WTA Championships'. This significantly reduces the dataset to only the matches of interest.\n\n3. **Filter Winners by Hand**:\n   - From the resulting set, exclude any matches where the winning player is not left-handed. This can be done either by:\n     - Directly using the `winner_hand` attribute from the `matches` table if this information is directly available and reliable.\n     - Alternatively, perform a join with the `players` table on `winner_id` to check the `hand` attribute for confirmation if additional player data validation is necessary. This step is optional and depends on the quality and consistency of the data within `matches`.\n\n4. **Select Unique Winners**:\n   - Use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that we are only counting unique left-handed winners.
