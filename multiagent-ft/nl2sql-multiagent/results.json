Given the plan, write ONLY the final SQL query with no extra text or formatting.\n\nPlan:\n1. **Identify the Main Tables**: We have two tables involved in this query: `stadium` and `concert`. The `stadium` table contains the `name` of the stadiums, and the `concert` table contains `stadium_id` and `year`.\n\n2. **Determine the Join Condition**: To find stadiums that have concerts, we need to join the `concert` table with the `stadium` table. The join condition is `concert.stadium_id = stadium.stadium_id`.\n\n3. **Filter for Specific Year**: We need to filter the concerts to only include those that occurred in the year 2014. This is done using a `WHERE` clause: `WHERE concert.year = 2014`.\n\n4. **Select Stadium Names with Concerts in 2014**: Using the join and filter conditions, select the names of stadiums that had concerts in 2014. This is done with the query:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT stadium.name \n   FROM concert \n   JOIN stadium ON concert.stadium_id = stadium.stadium_id \n   WHERE concert.year = 2014\n   ```\n\n5. **Select All Stadium Names**: Independently, select all stadium names from the `stadium` table:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT name FROM stadium\n   ```\n\n6. **Use EXCEPT to Exclude Stadiums with Concerts in 2014**: Use the `EXCEPT` clause to exclude the stadiums that had concerts in 2014 from the list of all stadiums. This combines the two previous queries:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT name FROM stadium\n   EXCEPT\n   SELECT stadium.name \n   FROM concert \n   JOIN stadium ON concert.stadium_id = stadium.stadium_id \n   WHERE concert.year = 2014\n   ```\n\nThis plan results in a query that lists all stadium names except those that hosted a concert in 2014.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

This will allow us to associate each student with their pets.\n\n   ```sql\n   FROM student AS T1\n   JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid = T2.stuid\n   ```\n\n2. **SELECT Clause**: Select the `StuID` from the `Student` table (T1) to identify each student. Also, use the `COUNT` function to count the number of pets associated with each student.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT T1.stuid, COUNT(T2.stuid) AS number_of_pets\n   ```\n\n3. **GROUP BY Clause**: Group the results by `StuID` from the `Student` table (T1) to ensure that the count of pets is calculated for each individual student.\n\n   ```sql\n   GROUP BY T1.stuid\n   ```\n\n4. **HAVING Clause (Optional)**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the subproblems, to ensure that only students with at least one pet are included, a `HAVING` clause can be added to filter out students with zero pets.\n\n   ```sql\n   HAVING COUNT(T2.stuid) > 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Complete SQL Query**: Combine all parts to form the complete SQL query.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT T1.stuid, COUNT(T2.stuid) AS number_of_pets\n   FROM student AS T1\n   JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid = T2.stuid\n   GROUP BY T1.stuid\n   HAVING COUNT(T2.stuid) > 0\n   ```\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",
