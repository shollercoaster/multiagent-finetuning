Use the student ID (`StuID`) as the joining key: `JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid = T2.stuid`.\n\n4. **Second JOIN**: Link the `Has_Pet` table to the `Pets` table to get information about the type of pet each student has. Use the pet ID (`PetID`) as the joining key: `JOIN pets AS T3 ON T3.petid = T2.petid`.\n\n5. **WHERE Clause**: Filter the results to include only those students who have a pet that is either a cat or a dog. Use the condition `WHERE T3.pettype = 'cat' OR T3.pettype = 'dog'`.\n\nBy following these steps, you construct a query that retrieves the first names of students who have either a cat or a dog as a pet.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

Given the plan, write ONLY the final SQL query with no extra text or formatting.\n\nPlan:\nTo generate the SQL query that answers the question \"What is the first name of every student who has a dog but does not have a cat?\", we can break down the process into the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Students with Dogs:**\n   - Start by selecting students who have a pet of type 'dog'.\n   - Join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table on `StuID`.\n   - Further join with the `Pets` table on `PetID` to filter for `PetType = 'dog'`.\n\n2. **Identify Students with Cats:**\n   - Create a subquery to find students who have a pet of type 'cat'.\n   - Similar to the first step, join the `Student` table with the `Has_Pet` table and then with the `Pets` table, filtering for `PetType = 'cat'`.\n\n3. **Exclude Students with Cats:**\n   - Use the subquery from step 2 to exclude students who have a cat from the list of students who have a dog.\n   - This can be done using a `NOT IN` clause.\n\n4. **Select the Required Information:**\n   - From the filtered list of students who have a dog but not a cat, select the `Fname` from the `Student` table.\n\nHere is the SQL query that implements the above plan:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T1.Fname\nFROM Student AS T1\nJOIN Has_Pet AS T2 ON T1.StuID = T2.StuID\nJOIN Pets AS T3 ON T3.PetID = T2.PetID\nWHERE T3.PetType = 'dog'\nAND T1.StuID NOT IN (\n    SELECT T1.StuID\n    FROM Student AS T1\n    JOIN Has_Pet AS T2 ON T1.StuID = T2.StuID\n    JOIN Pets AS T3 ON T3.PetID = T2.PetID\n    WHERE T3.PetType = 'cat'\n);\n```\n\nThis query effectively retrieves the first names of students who have a dog but do not have a cat by leveraging joins and subqueries to filter the data accordingly.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

This will give us students who do not own any pets.\n\n   ```sql\n   WHERE StuID NOT IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet)\n   ```\n\n5. **Calculate the Average Age**: Use the `AVG` function to calculate the average age of the students who meet the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(Age)\n   ```\n\n6. **Combine All Parts**: Combine all the parts to form the complete SQL query. This includes selecting the average age from the `Student` table while applying the condition to exclude students who own pets.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(Age)\n   FROM Student\n   WHERE StuID NOT IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet)\n   ```\n\nThis step-by-step plan outlines how to construct the SQL query to find the average age of students who do not own any pets.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

This can be done using a foreign key relationship, typically through `MakerID` or `MakerName`.\n     - Ensure that the join condition correctly links the car maker to the cars they produced.\n\n4. **Filter by Production Year:**\n   - Use a WHERE clause to filter the cars produced in the year 1970.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Query:**\n   - Combine all the above steps into a coherent SQL query.\n\nHere is the step-by-step SQL query plan:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T1.MakerName\nFROM CarMakers AS T1\nJOIN Cars AS T2 ON T1.MakerID = T2.MakerID\nWHERE T2.ProductionYear = 1970;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **SELECT DISTINCT T1.MakerName:** Selects unique car maker names.\n- **FROM CarMakers AS T1:** Specifies the main table containing car maker information.\n- **JOIN Cars AS T2 ON T1.MakerID = T2.MakerID:** Joins the `Cars` table to link each car to its maker using the `MakerID`.\n- **WHERE T2.ProductionYear = 1970:** Filters the results to include only those cars produced in the year 1970.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

The join condition is `T1.MakeId = T2.Id`, where `T1` is an alias for `CAR_NAMES` and `T2` is an alias for `CARS_DATA`.\n   - This step ensures that we can access both the `Model` and `edispl` columns in a single query.\n\n   ```sql\n   FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1\n   JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId = T2.Id\n   ```\n\n3. **Filter for Volvos**:\n   - Use a `WHERE` clause to filter the results to only include rows where the `Model` is 'volvo'.\n   - This step narrows down the dataset to only include Volvo vehicles.\n\n   ```sql\n   WHERE T1.Model = 'volvo'\n   ```\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Engine Displacement**:\n   - Use a `SELECT` clause to calculate the average of the `edispl` column for the filtered results.\n   - This step provides the final result, which is the average engine displacement for all Volvo vehicles.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(T2.edispl)\n   ```\n\n5. **Combine the Steps into a Complete Query**:\n   - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT AVG(T2.edispl)\n   FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1\n   JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId = T2.Id\n   WHERE T1.Model = 'volvo'\n   ```\n\nThis query plan outlines the process of joining the necessary tables, filtering for the specific make (Volvo), and calculating the average engine displacement.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

This requires two conditions:\n     - Cars weighing less than 4000.\n     - Cars weighing more than 3000.\n\n4. **Combine Conditions**:\n   - To ensure both conditions are met within the same year, we will use a subquery or a self-join to check for the existence of both conditions.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - Use a subquery to find years with cars weighing less than 4000.\n   - Use another subquery to find years with cars weighing more than 3000.\n   - Use an `INTERSECT` to find common years between these two subqueries.\n\nHere is the SQL query based on the plan:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT year\nFROM cars_data\nWHERE year IN (\n    SELECT year\n    FROM cars_data\n    WHERE weight < 4000\n)\nAND year IN (\n    SELECT year\n    FROM cars_data\n    WHERE weight > 3000\n);\n```\n\nThis query will return the distinct years where there are cars that meet both weight conditions.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

Therefore, the `SELECT` clause will include `DISTINCT T1.model`.\n\n2. **Determine the Tables to Use:**\n   - The main table containing model information is `MODEL_LIST`, which we will alias as `T1`.\n   - We need to join with `CAR_NAMES` (aliased as `T2`) to connect model names with their respective IDs.\n   - We also need to join with `CARS_DATA` (aliased as `T3`) to access the weight of the cars.\n   - Finally, join with `CAR_MAKERS` (aliased as `T4`) to get the full name of the manufacturer.\n\n3. **Establish the Joins:**\n   - Join `MODEL_LIST` (`T1`) with `CAR_NAMES` (`T2`) on the model name: `T1.Model = T2.Model`.\n   - Join `CAR_NAMES` (`T2`) with `CARS_DATA` (`T3`) on the make ID: `T2.MakeId = T3.Id`.\n   - Join `MODEL_LIST` (`T1`) with `CAR_MAKERS` (`T4`) on the maker ID: `T1.Maker = T4.Id`.\n\n4. **Apply the Filtering Conditions:**\n   - Use the `WHERE` clause to filter models with a weight less than 3500: `T3.weight < 3500`.\n   - Exclude models manufactured by 'Ford Motor Company': `T4.FullName != 'Ford Motor Company'`.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Query:**\n   - Combine all the above steps into a single SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT T1.model\nFROM MODEL_LIST AS T1\nJOIN CAR_NAMES AS T2 ON T1.Model = T2.Model\nJOIN CARS_DATA AS T3 ON T2.MakeId = T3.Id\nJOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T4 ON T1.Maker = T4.Id\nWHERE T3.weight < 3500 AND T4.FullName != 'Ford Motor Company';\n```\n\nThis query will return the distinct models that are lighter than 3500 and not manufactured by the 'Ford Motor Company'.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify Car Makers with at Least 2 Models:**\n   - **Join Tables:** Join the `CarMakers` table with the `Models` table to associate each car maker with their models.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT T1.id, T1.maker\n     FROM CarMakers AS T1\n     JOIN Models AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.maker_id\n     ```\n   - **Group and Filter:** Group the results by car maker ID and filter to find those with at least 2 models.\n     ```sql\n     GROUP BY T1.id\n     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT T2.model_id) >= 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Identify Car Makers with More than 3 Cars:**\n   - **Join Tables:** Join the `Models` table with the `Cars` table to count the number of cars each model has, and then join with `CarMakers` to associate with car makers.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT T1.id, T1.maker\n     FROM CarMakers AS T1\n     JOIN Models AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.maker_id\n     JOIN Cars AS T3 ON T2.model_id = T3.model_id\n     ```\n   - **Group and Filter:** Group the results by car maker ID and filter to find those with more than 3 cars.\n     ```sql\n     GROUP BY T1.id\n     HAVING COUNT(T3.model_id) > 3\n     ```\n\n3. **Combine Results Using INTERSECT:**\n   - Use the `INTERSECT` operation to find car makers that satisfy both conditions: producing at least 2 models and making more than 3 cars.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT T1.id, T1.maker\n     FROM CarMakers AS T1\n     JOIN Models AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.maker_id\n     GROUP BY T1.id\n     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT T2.model_id) >= 2\n     INTERSECT\n     SELECT T1.id, T1.maker\n     FROM CarMakers AS T1\n     JOIN Models AS T2 ON T1.id = T2.maker_id\n     JOIN Cars AS T3 ON T2.model_id = T3.model_id\n     GROUP BY T1.id\n     HAVING COUNT(T3.model_id) > 3\n     ```\n\nThis plan ensures that we accurately identify car makers meeting both criteria by leveraging SQL joins, grouping, and filtering, and finally combining the results with an `INTERSECT`.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",

Without specific schema details, I'll provide a general approach:\n\n1. **Airports Table**: This table would likely contain information about airports, including their names and the cities they are located in.\n\nAssuming a typical schema, the relevant columns might be:\n\n- `airport_name` (or similar): to get the names of the airports.\n- `city` (or similar): to filter airports located in 'Aberdeen'.\n\nBased on this, the relevant table and columns could be:\n\n```\nAirports: airport_name, city\n```\n\nIf you have specific schema details, please provide them for a more tailored response.\nSubproblems:\n```json\n{\n    \"subproblems\": [\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"SELECT\",\n            \"expression\": \"AirportName\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"FROM\",\n            \"expression\": \"AIRPORTS\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"WHERE\",\n            \"expression\": \"City = 'Aberdeen'\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nProvide a concise and to-the-point plan, each step describing how to build parts of the SQL.\n",

The relevant columns would include those that can help us count the number of flights per airport and identify the airport code.\n\nAssuming typical table structures, the relevant tables and columns might be:\n\n1. Flights table: This table would contain information about each flight, including the airport it departs from or arrives at.\n   - Table: Flights: airport_id\n\n2. Airports table: This table would contain information about each airport, including its code.\n   - Table: Airports: airport_id, airport_code\n\nThese tables and columns would allow us to count the number of flights per airport and then identify the airport code for the airport with the highest number of flights.\nSubproblems:\n```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"JOIN\",\n      \"expression\": \"AIRPORTS AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.AirportCode = T2.DestAirport OR T1.AirportCode = T2.SourceAirport\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"GROUP BY\",\n      \"expression\": \"GROUP BY T1.AirportCode\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"ORDER BY\",\n      \"expression\": \"ORDER BY count(*) DESC\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"LIMIT\",\n      \"expression\": \"LIMIT 1\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nProvide a concise and to-the-point plan, each step describing how to build parts of the SQL.\n",

The relevant column would likely be an identifier for each match, such as \"match_id\" or \"game_id.\"\n\nHere's an example of how you might list the relevant table and column:\n\n```\nTable: Matches: match_id\n```\n\nIf the schema provided includes different table or column names, you would adjust the names accordingly to match the schema.\nSubproblems:\n```json\n{\n    \"subproblems\": []\n}\n```\n\nProvide a concise and to-the-point plan, each step describing how to build parts of the SQL.\n",

The above is a general representation based on the question.\nSubproblems:\n```json\n{\n  \"subproblems\": [\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"JOIN\",\n      \"expression\": \"players AS T1 JOIN rankings AS T2 ON T1.player_id = T2.player_id\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"SELECT\",\n      \"expression\": \"avg(ranking), T1.first_name\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"clause\": \"GROUP BY\",\n      \"expression\": \"T1.first_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nProvide a concise and to-the-point plan, each step describing how to build parts of the SQL.\n",

This ensures that we only get unique entries for each winner.\n   - SQL: `SELECT DISTINCT winner_name, winner_rank`\n\n3. **Order the Results by Age**:\n   - To find the youngest winners, sort the results by `winner_age` in ascending order.\n   - SQL: `ORDER BY winner_age ASC`\n\n4. **Limit the Number of Results**:\n   - Since we are interested in the three youngest winners, use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output to the top 3 entries.\n   - SQL: `LIMIT 3`\n\n5. **Combine the Steps into a Complete Query**:\n   - Integrate all the steps into a single SQL query.\n   - Final SQL Query:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT DISTINCT winner_name, winner_rank\n     FROM Winners\n     ORDER BY winner_age ASC\n     LIMIT 3;\n     ```\n\nThis plan ensures that we retrieve the names and ranks of the three youngest winners by selecting distinct entries, ordering them by age, and limiting the results to the top three.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",
