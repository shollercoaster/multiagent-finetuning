Using the question, schema info, and subproblems, generate a step-by-step SQL query plan.\n\nQuestion: Find the name of airports which do not have any flight in and out.\nSchema Info:\nTo answer the question, we need to identify tables and columns related to airports and flights. We are looking for airports that do not have any flights in or out, which means we need to check for the absence of related flight records.\n\nHere is the list of relevant tables and columns:\n\n1. Table: Airports\n   - airport_id\n   - airport_name\n\n2. Table: Flights\n   - flight_id\n   - departure_airport_id\n   - arrival_airport_id\n\nThese tables and columns are necessary to determine which airports do not have any associated flights.\nSubproblems:\n```json\n{\n    \"subproblems\": [\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"SELECT\",\n            \"expression\": \"SELECT AirportName FROM Airports\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"WHERE\",\n            \"expression\": \"WHERE AirportCode NOT IN (SELECT SourceAirport FROM Flights UNION SELECT DestAirport FROM Flights)\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"SELECT\",\n            \"expression\": \"SELECT SourceAirport FROM Flights\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"UNION\",\n            \"expression\": \"SELECT SourceAirport FROM Flights UNION SELECT DestAirport FROM Flights\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"clause\": \"SELECT\",\n            \"expression\": \"SELECT DestAirport FROM Flights\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nProvide a concise and to-the-point plan, each step describing how to build parts of the SQL.\n",
          "output": "To find the names of airports that do not have any flights in or out, we can follow these steps to construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify Airports Table**: Start by selecting the airport names from the `Airports` table. This will be the main table from which we want to filter out airports with no flights.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT airport_name\n   FROM Airports\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify Flights Table**: Determine the airports that have flights either departing or arriving. This involves selecting both `departure_airport_id` and `arrival_airport_id` from the `Flights` table.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT departure_airport_id\n   FROM Flights\n   UNION\n   SELECT arrival_airport_id\n   FROM Flights\n   ```\n\n   - The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of both queries, ensuring that we get a distinct list of all airports involved in flights, either as a departure or arrival point.\n\n3. **Filter Airports with No Flights**: Use the result from the previous step to filter out airports that do have flights. We want airports whose `airport_id` is not in the list of airports with flights.\n\n   ```sql\n   WHERE airport_id NOT IN (\n       SELECT departure_airport_id\n       FROM Flights\n       UNION\n       SELECT arrival_airport_id\n       FROM Flights\n   )\n   ```\n\n4. **Combine Steps**: Integrate the above steps into a single SQL query to get the final result.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT airport_name\n   FROM Airports\n   WHERE airport_id NOT IN (\n       SELECT departure_airport_id\n       FROM Flights\n       UNION\n       SELECT arrival_airport_id\n       FROM Flights\n   )\n   ```\n\nThis query will return the names of airports that do not have any flights departing from or arriving at them."
