This will allow us to associate each student with their pets.\n     ```sql\n     FROM Student\n     JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID\n     ```\n   - **Join `Has_Pet` and `Pets`**: Use the `PetID` column to join the `Has_Pet` table with the `Pets` table. This will provide access to the details of each pet, including type and age.\n     ```sql\n     JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID\n     ```\n\n3. **Filter the Results**:\n   - Apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the pets to only those that are cats and have an age of 3. This ensures that only the relevant pets are considered in the final result.\n     ```sql\n     WHERE Pets.PetType = 'cat' AND Pets.pet_age = 3\n     ```\n\n4. **Construct the Final Query**:\n   - Combine all the steps into a single SQL query to retrieve the desired information.\n     ```sql\n     SELECT Student.LName\n     FROM Student\n     JOIN Has_Pet ON Student.StuID = Has_Pet.StuID\n     JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID\n     WHERE Pets.PetType = 'cat' AND Pets.pet_age = 3\n     ```\n\nThis plan outlines how to construct the SQL query step-by-step, ensuring that each part of the schema is utilized correctly to answer the question.\n\nReturn exactly one valid SQL statement.\n",
